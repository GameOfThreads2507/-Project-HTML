    <p style=" padding:16px; font-size: 20px;"> The Eiffel Tower (French: La Tour Eiffel, [tuʁ ɛfɛl], IPA pronunciation:
        "EYE-full" English; "eh-FEHL" French) is a
        famous landmark in Paris. It was built between 1 and 1889 for the Exposition Universialle (World Fair). The
        Tower was the Exposition's main attraction.
        The Eiffel Tower cost 7,799,401.31 French gold francs to build in 1889, an amount equal to $1,495,139.89 at that
        time. Today, it’s cost would equal $36,784,020.11.
        <br /> <br />It is 300 metres (984 ft.) tall, but this height does not include the 24 m (79 ft.) aerial (anten
        on the top; the total height of the structure is 324 m (1,063 feet). It has a square base that is 100 m (328
        ft.) long on each side. The second story platform is 115.5 meters (379 ft.) off the ground.There are also 1,710
        steps inside the Eiffel Tower, although visitors can only climb the first 703 steps to the first floor. In
        total, the tower weighs 10,000 tons, 7,300 of which are wrought iron. It consists of 18,038 pieces and 2.5
        million rivets put on by heat. The weight of paint used is 60 tons (12,000 gallons), and the surface to be
        painted is 250,000 square meters. Since it has been built it has been repainted 18 times. Each of these 18 paint
        jobs there were only 25 painters are hired to do the job.Three separate colors of paint are used on the
        structure in order to enhance the impression of height, with the lightest at the top.

        There are 20,000 sparkling lights and 80 kilometers of cables covering the structure. The paper used to print
        the visitors' tickets in one year weighs 2 tons. The top of the tower leans away from the sun as the metal
        facing the sun heats up and expands it can move as much as 7 inches and grow 6 inches taller.[12]The tower was
        also built to sway slightly in the wind.</p>
