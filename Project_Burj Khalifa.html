         Burj Khalifa (Arabic: برج خليفة‎, "Khalifa Tower") is a very tall skyscraper in
         Dubai, United Arab Emirates and is the tallest building ever built, at 828 metres
         (2,717 feet). Before the building opened, it was called Burj Dubai. The building is
         162 stories high. Construction of the tower was started in 2004. The building was officially
         opened on 4 January 2010.[2][3] It is the tallest structure made by humans in the world.
         The building is more than 300 metres (980 feet) taller than Taipei 101. Taipei 101 was the tallest
         building until 2010 before Burj Khalifa was built. Adrian Smith designed the tower.[4] He worked with
         Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) until 2006.[5] It was built by Samsung Engineering & Construction, Besix,
         and Arabtec.[6] The tower cost US
         $1.5 billion to build.[7] The building is part of a 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) building project on Sheikh Zayed
         Road, Downtown Burj
         Khalifa. It is near Dubai's main business district.<br /> <br />
         Burj Khalifa was built mainly by people from South Asia.[19][20] Press reports said in 2006 that skilled
         carpenters at the site earned UK£4.34 a day, and labourers earned UK£2.84.[19] According to a BBC investigation
         and a Human Rights Watch report, the workers lived in very bad conditions. Often they were not paid for the
         work. Their passports were taken by their employers. It was said that they were working in dangerous conditions
         that caused high number of deaths and injuries.[21] Companies not
         paying workers has been reported to the authorities several times.</p>
